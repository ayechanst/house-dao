TODO: get tasks to change state between active and grading. look in TaskDisplay could be there
or useState could be an alternative

* Phase 1 walkthrough
** Global variables
- membersMapping
  just returns true or false if member is there
- membersArray
  array of strings of group members
- taskArray
  has all the tasks
- runnerUp
  - variable is increased each time a task is voted to be active
  - it is used in ballot() to represent the task being voted on
** Functions
*** votingTask()
- returns a task at the index of the runnerUp
- if there are no tasks it will return a blank one
We have 4 scenarios:
- [X] No tasks yet at all
  - we can return a blank task that tells the UI to load a different component
- [X] The previous task wins
  - move onto the next task in the que
- [ ] The previous task wins and there are no new ones
- [ ] The previous task loses
- [ ] The previous task loses and there are no new ones
  - return a blank task
*** ballot()
- ticks up yes or no as votes flow in
if a task wins:
1. the runner up is set to active
2. yes and no are reset to 0
3. runner up ticks up to prepare ballot for the next task to vote on
else:
1. the runner up remains inactive

* Phase 2 ideas
- ppl can see votes in favor
