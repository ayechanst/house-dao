House DAO

* Cool features
** House Cred
Every member has "house cred" which is just reputation
* Phase 1
** members
are in an mapping
** task creation
people make task structs that go in a que array
** voting
*** Method 1
1. the oldest task is eligible for voting
2. after voting is done next task is up for voting
3. if wins, it gets pushed to active tasks
4. if it loses, nothing happens and next task is up for voting
** task execution
questions
*** how does it know which task?
**** good way
1. ideally an amount of time passed
2. click a button to make pass fake "time"
**** dumb way
1. task is input as a param
**** other dumb way
1. it iterates through the array and just checks if the task is approved

*** Method 1: using helper functions
- each task has an array of members
- assigned member is the first index of the array

task exection function()
- alters between done func and review func

task done function()
1. assigned member marks the task as completed
2. task is set to done and is now open for review

task review function(reviewer name)
1. grades task
2. when all members review tasks
3. moves to next member and marks status as not done

*** Method 2: using enums for status
- tasks have states => in progress, awaiting grade, result
**** in progress
- only the manager can call the function to await grading
- next step
**** awaiting grade (non-reputation based)
- only non-managers can call the function to give grade
steps
1. input name, and grade
2. when everyone is done
3. next step
How?
***** average grade variable
Q: how is it assigned to someone?
A:

**** assign house cred
- managers gets the grade averaged out
- reaps rewards/penalities
